# Stardew Simon

Stardew Simon provides a simple solution for capturing and displaying the sequence of colors played during the Simon Says game on Ginger Island in Stardew Valley. As you interact with the vibrant crystals nestled within the island's caves, the app listens to the melodious tones they emit, instantly showcasing the corresponding colors on the screen.

## How It Works

Stardew Simon utilizes advanced audio processing techniques to accurately detect the frequencies of tones produced by the crystals in the game. By analyzing the audio input from your device's microphone, the app identifies the dominant frequency associated with each crystal's unique color. These frequencies are then compared against predefined thresholds to determine the color of the crystal played.
